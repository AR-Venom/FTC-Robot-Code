> Sorry if the codes a bit of a mess rn, its just like my personality: somewhere between 'soft and organized' and 'trying to drown children' but im cleaning it up so it wont be messy for long -Aniket
EDIT: i have come to the realization that i am slow and unreliable and it will probably take me a while to clean the code up completely ¯\\__(ツ)__/¯
